# Towards Blockchain Enabled Infield Localisation

This project is a proof-of-concept infield localisation pipeline using smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network to notarise, store and retrieve images from the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) that have been correctly aligned to show a localisation match within an infield environment. Localisation is achieved by using ground stones adjacent to planted seeds to enable sub GNSS accuracy without expensive hardware requirements such as RTK-GNSS. This offers a novel way for low ground coverage crops such as onion or asparagus to  be re-identified to provide potential improved supply chain assurance.
